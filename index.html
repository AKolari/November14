CICD is a process where your code gets uploaded from git to your server
ticketing system:
ticket comes in. Has an ID and a change to be made, or some feature to be added.
we make the change, but want it to be reviewed.
To do so, we take our master branch, and make a new branch off of it. We add a new commit to this branch, and the name of the branch is the ticket.



git branch will list your branches
git checkout -b branchname will create a new branch, and you will switch to it
If you just want to switch, just git branch branchname
